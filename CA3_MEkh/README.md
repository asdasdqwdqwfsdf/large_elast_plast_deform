- `CA2_mekh.pdf`: formulation of assignment
- `cass2_mesh_data`: mesh to be used
- `f9_open_l_9`, `f9_open_u_9`, `m_2_v9`, `v9_2_m`: subroutines for products
with Voigt 9 formulation, matrix to voigt9 (or vice versa) transformation
- `neo_hooke.m`: implementation of compressible Neo-Hooke
- `nh.m`: result from nh.nb. In nh.nb the automatic differentiation package
Acegen (package for mathematica9) is used. nh.m is an implementation of
compressible Neo-Hooke. Note that the file tensorsME is used in Mathematica.
- `test_const.m`: test program for material subroutine
